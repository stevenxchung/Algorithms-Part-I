## Week 6: Hash Tables

> We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash function and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the *uniform hashing assumption* that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tables—*separate chaining* and *linear probing*. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption. We conclude with applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors.
